## ✨ Why Tessera?

### ✔ Modern & Minimal UI  
Smooth, distraction-free, and easier to use than traditional spreadsheet tools.

### ✔ Three Synchronized Views

### ✔ Safe Editing  
Tessera validates all changes before saving:
- Type mismatches  
- Invalid JSON  
- Broken schema rules  
- Missing required values  

No more corrupted CSV files.

### ✔ Built for Large Files  
Virtualized rendering keeps the UI smooth even with tens of thousands of rows.

### ✔ Game-Ready  
Perfect for:
- Level data  
- Config tables  
- Item definitions
